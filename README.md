## Network Details
* Vector/Matrix Math funcitons created from scratch (Linear Algebra Practice)
* Network is feedforward, using static backpropagation
* Contains customizability for numerous variables upon construction, including:
  * Number of layers and nodes per layer
  * Different activation functions
  * Learning rate
  * Batch size
